Gyaan pushpa



You must have seen ‘Chotu’ selling water bottles at a station or ‘Ramu kaka’ serving tea and washing dishes at roadside shops. Have you ever thought that they would also have dreamt of being educated.
In India thousand of people languish in  illiteracy and poverty, forced to work and earn to square meals a day. The vicious circle of poverty has spelt doom for the unprivileged ones. It is time that we the educated wake up and discharge our responsibilities in bringing about a change in the life style and culture for a larger development of the society.

The project ‘Gyaan Pushpa’ is aimed to usher enlightenment in the form of education in the life of such people such that they get the opportunity to improve their social economic status. As a prelude it is thus our duty to identify such children or adults in our locality. These people are everywhere working in tea-stalls, cycle shops or employed as roadside workers or anywhere around us. The concept of “each one teach one” can help us to revitalize the society.

Our website ‘Gyaan Pushpa’ aims to first identify such persons and the locality they inhabit and the houses they live in. It will be a wonder full experience for us to make a foray into these houses and homes and make shift shelters , the slums and the likes where these unprivileged citizens of our country resides.The ice once broken can help foster education in our own countrymen.
